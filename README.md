Attacking Active Directory<br>
  A Hacking Series
  
This repo will contain slides and information from the Attacking Active Directory Hacking Series talks presented at SecKC.

Module Breakdown:

Part 1: High-level Overview and Flow<br>
Part 2: Infrastructure and Initial Footholds<br>
Part 3: Internal Recon, Identifying Attack Paths<br>
Part 4: Taking the Domain<br>
Part 5: Post-Ex? Automation? Exfiltration? Avoiding Detection? Persistence?<br>

I want to make it clear that these are not the only methods used in attacking an infrastructure or that this is a pentest. This is more or less focused on gaining full control in an Active Directory environment.

Part 1: High-level Overview and Flow - December '17<br>
  Covers the basic theory on attacking Active Directory. It doesnt take a 0-day or uber l33t hacking skills to gain a foothold in an organization. After gaining network access attackers can quickly identify paths to Domain Admin and take over a network. Throughout the series we will walk through all these steps, in detail, to provide a better understanding of what attackers might look like in your network.
  We will continue to follow the path of Gain Credentials, Identify Access, Move Laterally, Gain More Credentials, and repeat until we own ourselves a nice pair of highly priviledged domain credentials.

Part 2: Infrastructure and Initial Footholds ~ January '18<br>
  This talk covers the setup required and used by attackers to manage a campaign. We first get Kali Linux up and running in an AWS environment then move on to our Command and Control software. After we are ready to catch shells, we look at a few different ways to gain an initial foothold into a target network. Using automated tools to scrape the web for possible usernames and email addresses we identify users found in public data breach's and look at how easy it is to guess a password.
